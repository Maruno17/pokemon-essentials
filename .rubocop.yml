# In a hash with multiple values (one per line), prefer the => to be lined up
# and text to otherwise be left-aligned.
Layout/HashAlignment:
  EnforcedHashRocketStyle: table
  EnforcedColonStyle: table

# This means hashes and arrays are written the same way, rather than hashes
# needing to be written like { foo => bar } while arrays are like [foo, bar].

# Yes, Essentials has classes/modules/methods that are too big and complex.

# Naming
#===============================================================================

# This cop forbids class/module names with underscores in them. Having

Naming/ClassAndModuleCamelCase:

# Script files are given names that look reasonable in the list of script
# sections in RMXP, and are all numbered. They won't be camel_case.

# The assign_to_condition style looks awful, indenting loads of lines and
# increasing the separation between variable and value being assigned to it.

# It's a choice between format and sprintf. We already make use of sprintf and

# String literals are not frozen by default, which makes this comment a
# pointless bit of boilerplate that we neither need nor want.
Style/FrozenStringLiteralComment:

# RMXP and Essentials use lots of global variables.
Style/GlobalVars:
  Enabled: false

# Mixing the styles within a hash just looks silly.
Style/HashSyntax:
  EnforcedStyle: no_mixed_keys

# unless just adds mental gymnastics trying to figure out what it actually
# means. I much prefer if !something.
Style/NegatedIf:
  Enabled: false

# .zero?, .positive? and .negative? are more wordy than == 0, > 0 and < 0. They
# also aren't consistent with other value comparisons, e.g. x > 42.
Style/NumericPredicate:
  EnforcedStyle: comparison

# Following this just means that calls to an affected method need to know what
# that method calls its parameters, which is ridiculous. Keep things short and
# simple.
Style/OptionalBooleanParameter:
  Enabled: false

# has_key? and has_value? are far more readable than key? and value?
Style/PreferredHashMethods:
  Enabled: false

# Explicit returns help to show whether a method returns a value.
Style/RedundantReturn:
  Enabled: false

# Enforcing the names of variables? To single letter ones? Just no.
Style/SingleLineBlockParams:
  Enabled: false

# Single line methods use up less space, and they're easier to list next to each
# other and see that they behave similarly.
Style/SingleLineMethods:
  Enabled: false

# Single quotes being faster is hardly measurable and only affects parse time.
# Enforcing double quotes reduces the times where you need to change them
# when introducing an interpolation or an apostrophe. Use single quotes only if
# their semantics are needed.
Style/StringLiterals:
  EnforcedStyle: double_quotes

# This cop requires arrays of symbols/text to be written like %i[a b c]. We
# don't need that nonsense. ["a", "b", "c"] is clearer and introduces no
# additional syntax to confuse people.
Style/SymbolArray:
  EnforcedStyle: brackets

# Patentheses around the condition in a ternary operator helps to differentiate
# it from the true/false results.

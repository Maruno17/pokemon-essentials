# Used in the random dungeon map.  Makes the levels of all wild Pokémon in that
# map depend on the levels of Pokémon in the player's party.
# This is a simple method, and can/should be modified to account for evolutions
# and other such details.  Of course, you don't HAVE to use this code.

# This is the basis of a trainer modifier.  It works both for trainers loaded
# when you battle them, and for partner trainers when they are registered.
# Note that you can only modify a partner trainer's Pokémon, and not the trainer
# themselves nor their items this way, as those are generated from scratch
# before each battle.

#  if e[0] # Trainer data should exist to be loaded, but may not exist somehow

#    items = e[0][1]   # An array of the trainer's items they can use
#    party = e[0][2]   # An array of the trainer's Pokémon

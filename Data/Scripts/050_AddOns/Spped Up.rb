# SPEEDUP_STAGES are the speed stages the game will pick from. If you click F, #
# it'll choose the next number in that array. It goes back to the first number #
#                                 afterward.                                   #

#             $GameSpeed is the current index in the speed up array.           #
#   Should you want to change that manually, you can do, say, $GameSpeed = 0   #
#                                                                              #
# If you don't want the user to be able to speed up at certain points, you can #
#                use "pbDisallowSpeedup" and "pbAllowSpeedup".                 #
